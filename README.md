## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpendSmart.git
cd SpendSmart
```

### üîê API Setup

Before building, create a new file in the project root called `APIKeys.swift`:

```swift
let supabaseURL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
let supabaseAnonKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
let supabaseServiceRoleKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
let geminiAPIKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
let secretKey = "YOUR_SECRET_BACKEND_KEY"
let imgBBAPIKey = "YOUR_IMGBB_API_KEY"
```

You can get these keys from:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) ‚Äì for the URL, anon key, and service role key  
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) ‚Äì to generate your Gemini API key  
- [imgBB](https://api.imgbb.com/) ‚Äì for image upload API keys  

Do **NOT** commit this file to version control.
